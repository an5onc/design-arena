# Round 01 — Results

**Winner:** Robert 🦅

**Why it won (Anson):**
- Higher translucency — background comes through the card clearly.
- Better glass edge — bright rim + soft inner glow sells the “glass slab” effect.
- More realistic depth — blur + shadow separation feels like it floats above the wallpaper.
- Material reads neutral glass — Bob’s looked more like tinted plastic (too uniformly purple/opaque) vs clear glass.

## What Anson Liked
- Strong translucency
- Illuminated rim treatment
- Soft inner glow
- Layered depth with clean separation from background
- Neutral/clear glass material over heavy tint

## What Anson Disliked
- Uniformly tinted/opaque card material
- Plastic-looking finish vs crystal/clear glass

## Non-Negotiables Going Forward
- Prioritize translucency over heavy tint.
- Use glass edge lighting (not flat borders).
- Build depth with blur + shadow layering so the element feels suspended.
- Keep material neutral and premium (avoid plastic look).
